# allegro-engine
A little "engine" I'm making to get more familiar with allegro5 and game engines.

# Compiling examples

make a directory called build and move into it

```mkdir build```

```cd build```

then run cmake 

```cmake ..```


and make

```make```

now the examples are in ./examples/<example_project/game>
