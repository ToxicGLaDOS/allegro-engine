title: Input

Input handles all the input gathering for your game. If you want to check out if a key is pressed you check with the functions `Input` gives to you. You should not try to create your own input instance though. Instead use the one that `Engine` creates automatically. To get this input from an `Object` check out the `_engine` field of your object and the `input` method of `Engine`.
