title: Matrix2x2
---

The main purpose for `Matrix2x2` is to apply tranforms to points. When using the transform functions of `Matrix2x2` make sure you understand that the transforms are done from the origin. Meaning if you rotate all the points of a square by 45 degrees and the square isn't centered at the origin you will end up moving the square as well as rotating it.
