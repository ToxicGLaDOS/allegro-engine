title: Transform
---

A `Transform` represents a collection of three pieces of data.

1. The postion (where the object is in the game)

2. The rotation (what angle the object is at)

3. The scale (how much bigger/smaller it should be than normal)

All `Object`s take this as an argument because it tells the engine where and how to render your objects.
