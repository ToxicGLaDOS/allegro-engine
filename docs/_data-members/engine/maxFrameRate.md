title: _maxFrameRate
definition: unsigned int _maxFrameRate

# Description
The highest frame rate the game will run at. Making this number higher will not boost the speed of the game at all. This number simply caps the frame rate to this number. Making this number higher than your computer can process the game at will have the effect of running as fast as possible. Slowing down the game can be useful if you want the game to run at the same rate as the refresh rate on your monitor, or if you want the game to run the same on all devices regardless of computational power.
