title: ctor
signature: Input()

# WARNING
You should not try to create an `Input` instance manually. Instead use the `_engine->input()` to get a reference to the `Input` created by `Engine`. However, for completeness this constructor will be described here.

# Description
Creates an `Input` instance. `Input` needs no arguments, because it comes ready to load inputs from everything that it can handle (keyboard, mouse, etc.).
