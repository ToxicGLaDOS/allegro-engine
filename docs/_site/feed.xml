        <title>Docs completed! (sort of)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The documentation has finally finished its first iteration! I will be working on the docs concurrently with the engine to keep everything as up-to-date as possible, and added more examples and more helpful descriptions to the various methods, and data members that aren&amp;#39;t explained as well as they could be. 
This is my first project this large and it has been very fun to work on so far. Hopefully I can make this into a useful engine in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
