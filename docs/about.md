This is the documentation for the allegro-engine! It is not a professional grade engine by any means, but you are welcome to look through the source code in its entirety, and edit it as you wish!

You can check out the github [here](https://github.com/smit8397/allegro-engine). I am not sure whether I want to accept pull requests right now, but if you have any ideas of things that should be added I would be glad to hear your suggestions! 

You can email me at jefferysmith8397@gmail.com if you have questions or suggestions.
